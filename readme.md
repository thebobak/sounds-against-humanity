# Sounds Against Humanity
*A lawsuit wating to happen...*
---

Some sounds are funny.  Some get funnier (and more offensive) when they're used in strange and inventive contexts.  This game adds a sensory experience to the popular card game, Cards Against Humanity, while retaining the tactile nature that makes card games so fun.

This game was created for and premiered at the event *Sound Scene VIII:  Play Along* on May 16, 2015 in Washington, DC.
