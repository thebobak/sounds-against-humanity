# Sounds Against Humanity #
*A lawsuit wating to happen...*

---

Some sounds are funny.  Some get funnier (and more offensive) when they're used in strange and inventive contexts.  This game adds a sensory experience to the popular card game, [Cards Against Humanity](https://cardsagainsthumanity.com), while retaining the tactile nature that makes card games so fun.

This game was created for and premiered at the event *Sound Scene VIII:  Play Along* on May 16, 2015 in Washington, DC.
